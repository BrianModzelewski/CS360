Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The objectives for this application included developing a functional tool incorporating a database to manage daily weight records, a designated target weight, and a login system with usernames and passwords. The application should facilitate user authentication through a single button, adding new users to the database if they are not already registered. Users should have the ability to delete their daily weight entries, while the target weight should be initially set and subsequently modifiable. The primary user needs addressed by this design are daily weight tracking and comparison with a target weight. Additionally, the application was intended to notify users upon reaching their target weight, although this feature is not operational in my current version due to time constraints. Nevertheless, all other functionalities are operational.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  The required screens included: login, home, history, add record, set/edit goal, and permissions. Each screen was designed with a clear primary function to ensure the app's usability. Keeping the users in mind, the designs aimed for simplicity and user-friendliness. There is no confusion regarding the purpose of each screen and how users should interact with them. The designs were successful in executing their tasks, with the exception of the settings screen where the notification feature is not yet implemented. Overall, the designs provide a clear and easy interaction experience, which is satisfying for users.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  Developing my app presented several challenges. Initially, I focused on designing the user interface (UI). Once that was in place, I tackled the implementation of the database and the Java code. I experimented with using fragments and instances to organize the interface, but found it cumbersome to integrate database functions that interacted with individual fragments effectively. As a result, I opted for another approach: using activities. This proved to be a much better solution, as each activity had its own Java class, allowing me to manage both the display and data manipulation more efficiently. Reflecting on this experience, I would prefer employing activities in future projects, as it simplifies the programming process significantly.
  Although I eventually managed to achieve dynamic population of fragments, I encountered another issue with deleting from the database. The problem arose because the IDs did not match up, leading to difficulties in dat


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  My primary method of testing involved running the app in emulators. While I recognize the importance of conducting JUnit tests, like many school projects, time constraints made it challenging to implement them. Instead, I relied heavily on Toasts to provide feedback when actions were successfully completed. This approach helped pinpoint areas where the code was breaking down and provided insights into how the app would perform in real-world usage on a physical device. While there is certainly room for improvement, especially in terms of incorporating more comprehensive testing methodologies, I am satisfied with how the app turned out considering it was my first attempt at developing an app.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  The database functions were where I had to innovate. I needed something that could dynamically populate a list of weights based on when they were entered. I initially did this by having a fragment and then calling an instance of it for each weight. This took quite some time, and eventually worked, but then I needed to be able to check which items to delete from that list and I could not figure out how to call the ID of a specific instance of a fragment and then use that in a database function. I ended up just making empty data targets and then dynamically populating them so that I could isolate my targets when I needed to.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  I believe the UI was where I most successfully demonstrated my skills. I think the back end needs improvement, espeically the loops, but the UI, in my opinion, is pretty clean and minimalist. I also think the login worked out really well in my case. I took it on myself to implement encryption and only store encrypted passwords for user security and I think that showcased my ability to adapt code and learn quickly
